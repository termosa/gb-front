## Getting started

Before you can start developing your awesome application you need to install the project's dependencies. Make sure you have Node (>= 10.13.0) and NPM installed and run:

```sh
$ npm install
```

### ‚å®Ô∏è Development

Once all dependencies have been installed you can start development. To start a development server on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) run:

```sh
$ npm run dev
```

### üñ• Production

To run your application in production make sure to run a build first:

```sh
$ npm run build
```

And then start you application with a provided port number (defaults to 3000 if not provided):

```sh
$ PORT=8080 npm run start
```

### üñ® Static

You can export your application to a static website as well:

```sh
npm run export
```

This will render static HTML pages into `./out`

### üßê Linters

The boilerplate provides a couple of linters to help you keep an eye on code consistency and type safety. There are three linters: one for CSS, one for TypeScript and one for type safety. You can use each of them separately using the following commands:

```sh
$ npm run lint:css
$ npm run lint:ts
$ npm run lint:types
```

TIP: To get the most out of your linters install the corresponding (Stylelint, TSLint) plugins for your editor or IDE

**Prettier**

Prettier helps you to enforce consistent (opinionated) code style. If possible, you can tell your editor to format you code when you save a file. If you are not able to do this, you can run prettier manually using:

```sh
$ npm run prettier
```

### ü§ñ Tests

You can write your tests using Jest and Enzyme. You can run all test with the following command

```sh
$ npm run test
```

If you want to follow test driven development you can use:

```sh
$ npm run test:dev
```

## Modules

### SCSS

By default, the path `./src/common/css` is configured as an included path for our scss loader.
This means you can import any of this folder's files directly without the relative or absolute path:

```css
@import 'variables';
@import 'colors';
```
